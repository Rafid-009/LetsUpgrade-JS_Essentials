# Variables, Operators & Conditional Statements

## Variables

**Variables can be declared by 3 things:**<br>
+ **console.log()**: We can override it later. By asigning a value to the same variable.
+ **let**: Can't be overrided. Gives a SyntaxError.
+ **const**: Can't be overrided. Gives a TypeError.

## Operators

* Arithmatic: +,-,*,/, %, ++, --
* Logical
* Assignment
* Comparism: == (only compares the value), === (this compares the value, also the datatype), !=, !==, >, <, <=, >=
* Type


## Array 

Array class is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high-level, list-like objects.

 Arrays Methods : 

Push method is used the push element in the array.
Pop method is used to delete an element from the end.
Shift method is used to remove an element from the beginning.
Unshift method is used to add an item at the beginning of the array.
Splice is used to remove an element from its index position.
Slice is used to slice the elements of the array.

# Functions and Objects 

## Objects: 
Object methods are used to store multiple data. We can access objects through key values or also with the element.

## Functions: 
A function is a Sub Program that is externally called or invoked by code that performs some basic task. We can provide values as Parameters or Arguments to the function. When Parameters are unknown we can pass array-like objects as arguments.

# Object Methods and Spread Operator

## Shallow Copy: 
A shallow copy has common data shared between the copy and the original. The destination object contains a separate copy of name, age, and designation. Reference of Complex Object (“address”) is copied to Destination Object.

## Deep Copy: 
The object is said to be deep copied when each property to the object points to a separate copy, even if the property points to an object (reference values). Separate Reference for Complex Objects (“address”) is created.

## Spread Operator : 
Spread syntax (...) allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.

# DOM Manipulation

## DOM Manipulation : 
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:

## Ways to Access DOM: 
There are five ways through which we can access the DOM. 

+ GetbyID 
+ GetbyClassName 
+ GetbyTagName 
+ GetbyQuerySelector 
+ GetbyQuerySelectorAll
